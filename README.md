# Surface-Pattern-Accelerator

Surface Pattern Accelerator is a vector graphics editor that is built under a lightweight server. It aims to be an editor capable of generating vector-based collections and patterns much faster than its competitors such as Affinity Designer and Inkscape.

## Vision

Our vision is to develop a specialized software package capable of creating patterns comparable to patterns created in software like Inkscape and Adobe Illustrator. The system should cater for all users, regardless of their experience in design. This software will have features exclusively geared towards pattern generation; it will only be able to generate patterns but in having such a specific vision it will do it in a much more efficient way than other software not meant to create patterns but used as such.

## Github branching 
We will be using monorepo with gitflow
- We will have multiple feature branches for code development
- We will have development branches for our integration and regression testing
- We will have release brances for different versions of our working prototypes
- We will have a master branch for our working prototypes
